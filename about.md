# 👋 Welcome to Mile High Cloud

Hi, I’m **Setorli Guddah**, a tech professional with over 12 years of experience in IT support, systems analysis, and service delivery.

In 2025, I decided to elevate my career — literally — by transitioning into **cloud engineering and cybersecurity**. This blog is where I document that journey: through labs, certifications, home projects, and lessons learned.

## 🧭 My Background

- Experienced in Windows OS (XP to 11), Active Directory, DNS, DHCP
- Strong history in end-user support and technical troubleshooting
- Hands-on with Microsoft 365, endpoint security, and desktop imaging
- Recently certified in **AZ-900** and actively pursuing **AZ-104**

## 🌩️ Why "Mile High Cloud"?

Because I believe in going above the basics. This blog is not just about following tutorials — it’s about:
- Learning by doing
- Reflecting on mistakes
- Sharing knowledge to help others grow too

## 🧪 What You'll Find Here

- Azure home labs & cloud configurations
- Cybersecurity projects and tools (like Defender, Sentinel)
- Career transition notes: from IT Support → Cloud & Cybersecurity

## 🚀 My Goal

To become a skilled **Cloud Engineer** and eventually a **Cloud Security Specialist**, combining my real-world IT experience with modern, scalable infrastructure knowledge.
